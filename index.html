			<h2>Hobbies</h2>
	
			<ul>
			<li> <h3>Piano</h3></li>
			<p>Being a self-taught pianist isn't always easy, but it's really rewarding. I absolutely love music, and playing it from time to time is my ultimate hobby.</p>
			<li><h3>Scuba-diving</h3></li>
			<p>Despite being a very dangerous sport, scuba-diving can erase all the stressful events in a lifetime. I had the chance to dive in a known spot in the North of Morocco (M'diq), since then I've been hooked to this sport. </p>
			<li><h3>Theater</h3></li>
			<P>In highschool, I had a theatrical troupe and we took the stage twice per year. It was an amazing experience, it helped me not to be shy in public. </p>
			</ul>

			<h2>My favourite book</h2>

			<li> <h3>Les Essais, Montaigne</h3></li>
			<p>Many authors influenced me profoundly, and Montaigne is definitely one of them. I would only quote him once in this page, I promise : "Every man detains the whole form of human condition" </p>
